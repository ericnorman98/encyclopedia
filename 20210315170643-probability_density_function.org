* Probability density function
In [[file:20210313082049-probability_theory.org][probability theory]], the probability density function is a function that
specifies the probability of a random variable falling within a particular range
of values. It is not the absolute likelihood for taking a value since that would
be zero (because of the infinite set of values).
