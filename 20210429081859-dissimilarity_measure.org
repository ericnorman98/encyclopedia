* Dissimilarity measure
A dissimilarity measure (or distance measure) for features $x_1,x_2$ is a
function such that
\begin{equation}
d(x_1,x_2)\ge 0 \;\text{ and }\; d(x_1,x_2)=d(x_2,x_1)
\end{equation}

The definition of dissimilarity across multiple features can look like this
\begin{equation}
D(\pmb{x_1},\pmb{x_2})=\sum_{j=1}^p d_j(x_1^{(j)},x_2^{(j)})
\end{equation}

Examples of dissimilarity measures include the l1 and [[file:20210429082944-euclidean_distance.org][l2 norm]],
