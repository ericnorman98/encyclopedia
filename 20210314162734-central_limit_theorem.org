* Central limit theorem
Let $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ denote a random sample from the distribution $X$ with
mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For large $n$, then $\bar{X}$ is
approximately normal with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2/n$. For large $n$,
the random variable $(\bar{X}-\mu)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})$ is approximately standard
normal, even if $X$ isn't a normal distribution.
